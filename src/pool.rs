//! A multi-station connection pool: dials several [`Session`]s concurrently
//! (bootstrap seeds, optionally grown by discovering more via
//! `hecate_stations.list_stations`) and gives [`Pool::call`]/
//! [`Pool::publish`] a choice of which connected one to use, instead of a
//! caller managing a single [`Session`] by hand.
//!
//! **Call/Publish only — no pooled Subscribe.** [`Session::run_subscriber`]'s
//! own doc (and [`Session::call`]'s) already say a control stream can't
//! safely serve an in-flight Call's response-wait and an ongoing Subscribe
//! EVENT loop at once — each discards frames it doesn't recognize, so they'd
//! steal each other's frames. Building a pool-wide Subscribe fan-out
//! properly would need either a second `Session` per link dedicated to it,
//! or a real frame-demultiplexing layer on top of `Session` (dispatch by
//! `call_id`/frame-type to whichever waiter wants it) — genuinely new
//! infrastructure, out of scope here. A caller that needs Subscribe still
//! uses a bare [`Session::subscribe`]/[`Session::run_subscriber`] directly,
//! unpooled, exactly as before this module existed.
//!
//! Ported from the same station-discovery/link-rotation design already
//! shipped in `macula-go` (`pool/discovery.go`, v0.7.0) and `macula-dotnet`
//! (`StationDiscovery.cs`, v0.4.0) — see those crates' own doc comments for
//! the fuller cross-language history. This is a from-scratch build, not a
//! port of an existing pool: this crate had no `Seed`/multi-link concept at
//! all before this module.
//!
//! **Per-link trust, not one fixed mode for the whole pool** — this is the
//! one deliberate design difference from the go/dotnet ports, made possible
//! by building from scratch rather than extending an existing single-Trust
//! pool: a discovered station whose directory row has NO `hostname` (only a
//! bare-IP `host_advertised`) but DOES carry a `node_id` dials under
//! `Trust::Pinned(node_id)` instead of being skipped outright the way
//! go/dotnet's ports skip every hostname-less row under `Trust::WebPki`
//! (which can never validate a bare IP with no IP SANs). The underlying
//! MECHANISM mirrors a shipped, live-verified precedent in a completely
//! different codebase: `macula-apps/macula-cam2me`'s Android client
//! (`reachability/StationDiscovery.kt`), confirmed against the real fleet
//! by 34 (`macula`'s own reference-implementation session) independently
//! reaching the identical conclusion this module reaches, including a
//! live TLS-layer `verify=none` warning from `macula_quic` when dialing a
//! hostname'd station by IP+Pinned instead of its usual WebPki path.
//!
//! **This module's PRIORITY ORDER deliberately differs from cam2me's own,
//! in the safer direction** — cam2me picks Pinned(node_id) whenever a row
//! carries a node_id at all (true of essentially every row), falling back
//! to hostname/WebPki only when `host_advertised` itself is missing; that
//! trades away TLS-layer MITM resistance for the common case, not just the
//! no-DNS one. Here, [`dial_target_from_station_row`] prefers `hostname`
//! unconditionally — `Trust::Pinned` is chosen only when a row has NO
//! usable hostname at all, so a normal Let's-Encrypt-backed station still
//! dials WebPki exactly as it always has; only a genuine no-DNS station
//! (`stations-linode-toronto` — see `tests/live_station.rs`'s own
//! `pinned_trust_full_handshake_succeeds_against_toronto`) ever falls to
//! Pinned. Bootstrap seeds are entirely unaffected either way — they
//! always dial under the pool's own configured `Trust`.
