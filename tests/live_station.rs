//! Integration tests against real, live macula-station boxes.
//!
//! **Not run by default CI** — every test here is `#[ignore]`d, since it
//! depends on external infrastructure this crate doesn't own or control
//! (network reachability, the fleet's own uptime). Run explicitly with:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test --test live_station -- --ignored --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! **DNS gotcha, confirmed directly against the live box (2026-08-28):**
//! the bare `macula.io` hostname has an A (IPv4) record but genuinely no
//! AAAA record at all, while `macula-station-frankfurt`'s actual QUIC
//! listener (confirmed via `ss -ulnp` on the box itself) is bound to a
//! *specific* IPv6 address that has no relationship to the A record.
//! Dialing `macula.io` therefore resolves to a real, reachable IPv4
//! address with nothing listening on port 4433 — every packet vanishes
//! silently (correct, spec-compliant QUIC behavior for unrecognized
//! traffic, indistinguishable from a firewalled port from the client
//! side alone). `station-de-frankfurt.macula.io` is the name that
//! actually resolves to the listener's real IPv6 address — this matches
//! the DNS-repoint gotcha already on file in project memory
//! (`reference_demo_fleet_boxes`), confirmed still true today.
