//! Live proof that direct-dial's resolve-and-dial core, already verified
//! for plain RPC (`tests/live_station.rs`) and cert-chain authorization
//! (`tests/live_cert_chain.rs`), reuses cleanly for streaming and content
//! transfer too — mirrors `macula-go-sdk`'s own `OpenStreamDirect`/
//! `PutDirect`/`GetDirect` live tests.
//!
//! Separate identities per role throughout: this fleet enforces one
//! connection per identity and kicks whichever connects second (confirmed
//! multiple times this session), so a provider/caller/resolver sharing one
//! identity self-inflicts a kick rather than testing anything real.
//!
//! Not run by default CI — `#[ignore]`d, matching this crate's other live
//! tests. Run explicitly with
//! `cargo test --test live_direct_dial_extensions -- --ignored --nocapture`.
